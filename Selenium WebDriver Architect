Selenium WebDriver Architecture:

	•	After you trigger the Test, complete Selenium code (Client) which we have written   will be converted to Json format
	•	Generated Json is sent to Browser Driver (Server) through http Protocol
    Note: Each browser contains a separate browser driver
	•	Browser drivers communicate with its respective browser and executes the commands by interpreting Json which It received on the browser.
	•	Browser Driver receives responses back from the browser and it sends Json response back to Client.

   =================================Below is the step by step or in simpler language to grasp the thing ==============                   

If I put in simpler terms the below:
1. Test Execution:

- When you run a test, the Selenium code you wrote (Client) gets converted into a JSON format.

2. Communication with Browser Driver:

- The JSON commands are sent to the appropriate Browser Driver (like ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, etc.) using the HTTP protocol.
Note: Each browser has its own specific driver (e.g., Chrome has ChromeDriver, Firefox has GeckoDriver).

3.Browser Driver's Role:

- The Browser Driver interprets the JSON commands and communicates with the browser to execute the instructions.

4. Response Handling:

- Once the browser completes the commands, the Browser Driver collects the results and sends a JSON response back to the Client.
This architecture enables smooth communication between your test code and the web browser.
